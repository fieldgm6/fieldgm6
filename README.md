Hi, I'm Garrett. I'm not very good with intro's but here we go anyways. I like cooking, computers, and cats. I'm interested in infosec. Currently I'm learning C# via freecodecamp. I'm also reviewing python, and bash scripting. Nim, and android apps. The list goes on... lifelong learning and all that. I don't have any ongoing projects, at least not ones that involve coding. I'm not really looking to collab. Love is love, people are people. Be decent to eachother.
